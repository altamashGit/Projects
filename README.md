#Project--1: Django App Deployment Script

The current project in this repository is the Django App Deployment Script, which automates the deployment of a Django application using Docker and Nginx. It covers essential tasks like:

--Cloning the code repository.
--Installing required dependencies (Docker, Nginx).
--Managing system services.
--Building and running the Docker container for the Django app.
